ENIGMA
Support for German enigma machines seems complete, except from the uhr attachment.
3- and 4-wheel machines have been tested, and correctly decrypts historic WWII messages.
Some historic enigma machines show 00-26 on the rings instead of letters. This is 
currently unsupported.


FIALKA
* czech code wheels with cyrillic symbols implemented
  - lacks the other code wheels
  - don't support alternate alphabets (latin, numbers)
  - proton2 not implemented, so no core swapping etc.
  - no numeric mode
* untested, don't know if it encrypts correctly
  - don't know if wheels are supposed to move before or
    after the pressed key is encrypted
  - decrypts its own messages correctly
  - wheels move as documented, as far as I can tell
* Bug when trying to change the card reader setting
* Card reader should not be called plugboard

FURTHER WORK
* Noninteractive mode, for encrypting/decrypting whole files.
* Better display, the fialka uses too many lines (10 lines for 10 wheels)
* Show notches/blocking pins on the wheel display
* Show ringstellung as a dot on the code wheel, as in real life.
* A third window with help text
* Mouse support. Exists in curses, so possible.
