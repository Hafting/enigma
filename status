ENIGMA
Support for German enigma machines seems complete, except from the uhr attachment.
3- and 4-wheel machines have been tested, and correctly decrypts historic WWII messages.
Some historic enigma machines show 01-26 on the rings instead of letters. This is 
not supported directly - use 01=A, 02=B, .., 26=Z 

FIALKA
* czech code wheels with cyrillic symbols implemented
  - lacks the other code wheels
  - don't support alternate alphabets (latin, numbers)
  - proton2 not implemented, so no core swapping etc.
  - no numeric mode
* untested, don't know if it encrypts correctly
  - don't know if wheels are supposed to move before or
    after the pressed key is encrypted
  - decrypts its own messages correctly
  - wheels move as documented, as far as I can tell
* Bug when trying to change the card reader setting

FUNCTIONALITY
* Interactive encryption/decryption and key setting:
  enigma enigma-m4
* Produce Vig√®nere table for the machine's code wheels:
  enigma enigma-m4 -t

FURTHER WORK
* Noninteractive mode, for encrypting/decrypting whole files.
* A third window with help text
* Mouse support. Exists in curses, so possible.
