# enigma
ncurses-based simulator for enigma &amp; fialka code machines

The program lets you encode & decode as if you had such a machine. 
It also allows experimentation with different code wheels and machine layouts. The simulator is generic
and uses a text file that describes the exact code machine to be emulated.
